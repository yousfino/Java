# Description

StrikeEdgeZero is a 1-player game consisting of a sequence of integers.

The rules of the game are simple. The circle on the initial square is an initial marker that can move 
to other positions along the sequence. At each step in the game, you may move the marker the number 
of positions indicated by the integer in the square it currently occupies. The marker may move either 
left or right along the row but may not move past either end. For example, in the above array, the only 
legal first move is to move the marker four squares to the right because there is no room to move four
spaces to the left.

The goal of the game is to move the marker to the far-right index (the Edge), which always contains 
“0”.
